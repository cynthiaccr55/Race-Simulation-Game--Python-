# 🏎️ Race Simulation Game (Python)

This is my first Python project.

The program simulates a race between three cars with:
- countdown start
- random engine failure
- lap-by-lap simulation
- distance calculation
- final winner

This project helped me practice loops, conditionals, and basic logic in Python.
